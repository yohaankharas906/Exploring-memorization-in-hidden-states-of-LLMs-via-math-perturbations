# MATH-Perturb: Benchmarking LLMs' Math Reasoning Abilities against Hard Perturbations

Evaluation code and dataset for the ICML 2025 paper [MATH-Perturb: Benchmarking LLMs' Math Reasoning Abilities against Hard Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06453).

For more details and the leaderboard, please refer to the project page [here](https://math-perturb.github.io/).

## Dataset Usage

The MATH-P-Simple and MATH-P-Hard datasets are located in `math_perturb/`. Each testset is a `jsonl` file, where each line represents a test datapoint in `json` format. You can load the dataset with the following Python code:

```python
dataset = [json.loads(line) for line in open(filepath)]
``` 

### Keys:

- `problem_id`: A unique random problem id assigned to each of the *original* problem. The modified problems sharing the same `problem_id` are perturbed from the same original problem.
- `problem`: Problem statement.
- `answer`: Ground-truth answer to the problem.
- `level`: The difficulty level that originates from MATH dataset. The field will be `"Level 5"` for all the entries.
- `type`: Category of the math problem, e.g., Algebra, Calculus, etc. 
- `original_split`: The split (`train` v.s. `test`) where the original problem belongs.


**Note: Please do not use MATH-P-Simple or MATH-P-Hard as training data.**



## Evaluation 

The evaluation script extracts the answers within `\boxed{}`, post-processes the potentially unformatted answer string, and then utlizes SymPy package to check the equivalence of two latex strings. Please read the [README](/evaluation/README.md) for details. The entry point is the `answer_check` method in `evaluate.py`. This can be adapted both in evaluation and in RL training.

``` python
def answer_check(problem, solution_str, ground_truth, dataset_type):
    """
        Checks if the predicted answer matches the ground truth answer.
        Args:
            problem (str): The problem statement.
            solution_str (str): The solution string containing the predicted answer.
            ground_truth (str): The ground truth answer string.
            dataset_type (str): The type of dataset, either 'perturb' or 'original'.
        Returns:
            is_correct (bool): True if the predicted answer matches the ground truth answer, False otherwise.
    """
```

## Legal Compliance


Intended Usage:

- The dataset is only for **academic research purposes**, and we do not seek to monetize or commercialize the problems & answers.
- The MATH-Perturb datasets (both MATH-P-Simple and MATH-P-Hard) are intended to be used as **test datasets** (benchmarks) to **evaluate** large language models. 
- The datasets should **not** be used for training the models under any circumstance.

Transformative differences from MATH dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021):

- We have transformed the problems from the original MATH dataset by making edits directly to the problem statements. 
- For our two variants MATH-P-Simple and MATH-P-Hard, we have worked on the modified problems ourselves to get the correct answers. We only released the final answers without the intermediate steps.
- We have ensured that the answers to our perturbed problems are different from the answers to the corresponding original problems.
